## Railway Reservation Management System using Python and MySQL

During COVID, it was* very difficult to manage social distancing at platforms and reduce infection risk. The key solution is to make these services available in user's hands. RRMS aims to make this process efficient and reliable via **integrating python and MySQL** database to organize this information.

I developed and designed a management system using python and MySQL database to provide all railway reservation related services.

## Framework
Python will enable users to enter their details rapidly without making any error.

MySQL will express booking details in a tabular way, allowing them to view details easily and in a comfortable manner.
